## Description

This payload exfiltrate the target's Windows product key to a remote server. *Only works on Windows 10,11.*

## Usage

### Setup

```
python -m http.server 80
```
- Download the "payload.txt" and "script.ps1" files and modify them to include the IP address of your server.
- Move the modified "script.ps1" file to the root directory of your website, so it is downloadable from this address:
```
http://<REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS>/script.ps1
```

### Analysis

Once the payload is executed, you can find the target's IP address and Windows product key by checking your website logs.


***Note**: This script is designed to send the results to a specific server, so you don't have to rely on any file sharing services. Additionally, you can easily adapt it to work with encrypted sites.*
